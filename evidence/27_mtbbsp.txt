§  Additional notes

§  Validation: We need to be able to save the form and bypass the validation as we do have operational needs for this. There are times when we move a casualties between facilities and change who is completely the form. Thus, we need to be able to “save the form”, but not “submit the form”. However, this now means that we need to be able to have a visual indication of “non-submitted” forms. One suggestion for this would be have “non-submitted” forms in red, and submitted forms in black.

·        Overall:

o   We need a “save” button, that does not check validation

o   We need a “submit” Button, that does check validation
